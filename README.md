Using the [Shopify-App-CLI](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-cli)

The technos used are :

# Installation
Clone the starter then npm i

## Develop
start the server
`PORT=8081 npm run dev`

Then open a tunnel with ngrok :
`ngrok http 8081 --subdomain=livingcolor`

# Build and deploy
Build the nextJS files
`npm run build`

# Create the public or custom app on the partner shopify website

# Install on an ECS server (AWS)

- Choose an ECS server on AWS
- once installed, get connect (with the .pem key given by AWS)
  ```
  ssh -i ~/.ssh/aws-mykey.pem ubuntu@url.eu-west-3.compute.amazonaws.com
  ```
- Install Node `https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md`
- Install `n` to manage versions of node and npm
- install the version you want `n 12`
- Install pm2 `npm i -g pm2`
- Launch pm2 on server boot : `sudo pm2 startup`
- Install a logrotate : `pm2 install pm2-logrotate`
- Create a key `ssh-keygen` then paste this key in the github project's settings (deploy keys) and be sure to have this type of url : `git@github.com:{user}/{repo}.git`
- Install nginx
- For nginx to work as a Reverse proxy on NodeJS + Koa, your nginx config must contain :
  `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;`
  Koa in server.js : `server.proxy = true;`

This way a setCookie `secure` will be well served by Koa even if your server is in HTTP (bc it checks `X-Forwarded-Proto` which contains https
